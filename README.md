## Setup a project
To create a project, run:

```
npx create-next-app
```
In the terminal, you will be asked
What is your project named? Provide a name for the project

Go to the project folder:
```bash
cd my-test-nextjs
```
Then run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

There is a README with tips for using next app. It is created by create-next-app. I will add my notes above these tips.

Then create a GitHub repository, and follow their tips, run 
```
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [https://github.com/user/repo.git]
git push -u origin main
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
